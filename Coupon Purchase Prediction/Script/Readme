#Kaggle Competition of Coupon Purchase Prediction.

Using past purchase and browsing behavior, this competition asks us to predict which coupons a customer will buy in a given period of time. The resulting models will be used to improve Ponpare's recommendation system, so they can make sure their customers don't miss out on their next favorite thing.
I used scikit-learn logistic regression to classify and then probability estimates to determine which coupon will be bought by the customer.
