# Kaggle Competition of Caterpillar Tube Pricing.

This competition provided us detailed tube, component, and annual volume datasets, and challenges us to predict the price a supplier will quote for a given tube assembly. 

I tried both scikit-learn ensemble and xgboost random forrest algorithm to predict the price.
